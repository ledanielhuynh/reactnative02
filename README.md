# reactnative02

## Features

### 1. Task Creation
- **Add New Tasks**: Create tasks with a **title**, **description**, and **due date** to clearly define your to-do items.
- **Persistent Storage**: Your tasks are saved across sessions, ensuring no information is lost.

### 2. Task Management
- **Edit Tasks**: Update any task's fields (name, description, due date) as your priorities change.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks that are no longer relevant.

### 3. Task Organisation

  - **Yellow** for tasks due within 1 week
  - **Green** for tasks due in more than 1 week
